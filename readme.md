## Titanic Survival Prediction

This contains the ipython notebook and code for my submission to Kaggle's Titanic competition

## Instructions to view the ipython notebook

### Anaconda

Anaconda is a free distribution of the Python programming language for large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing that aims to simplify package management and deployment.

Follow instructions to install [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install) or the more lightweight [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html).

### Module Dependencies

You will need to install the following modules in order to run the code inside your notebook.
You will also need these to run the solution in the terminal
  - virtualenv 
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib

### Steps

Assuming that anaconda and the module dependencies are installed, we can view our notebooks by running jupyter-notebook in the cloned directory.

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/kiosklabs/kaggle-digit-recognizer-competition.git`
2. Enter directory: `cd kaggle-digit-recognizer-competition`
3. Run Jupyter: `jupyter-notebook`

After this, a new tab will open in your window that will display the jupyter notebook browser with the current folder set as home.
