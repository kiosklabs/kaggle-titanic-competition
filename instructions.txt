Introduction

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS:
survival        Survival
(0 = No; 1 = Yes)
pclass          Passenger Class
  (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
  name            Name
  sex             Sex
  age             Age
  sibsp           Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
  parch           Number of Parents/Children Aboard
  ticket          Ticket Number
  fare            Passenger Fare
  cabin           Cabin
  embarked        Port of Embarkation
                  (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

SPECIAL NOTES:
Pclass is a proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st ~ Upper; 2nd ~ Middle; 3rd ~ Lower

Age is in Years; Fractional if Age less than One (1)
If the Age is Estimated, it is in the form xx.5

With respect to the family relation variables (i.e. sibsp and parch)
some relations were ignored.  The following are the definitions used
for sibsp and parch.

Sibling:  Brother, Sister, Stepbrother, or Stepsister of Passenger Aboard Titanic
Spouse:   Husband or Wife of Passenger Aboard Titanic (Mistresses and Fiances Ignored)
Parent:   Mother or Father of Passenger Aboard Titanic
Child:    Son, Daughter, Stepson, or Stepdaughter of Passenger Aboard Titanic

Other family relatives excluded from this study include cousins, nephews/nieces, aunts/uncles, and in-laws.  Some children travelled
only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.  
As well, some travelled with very close friends or neighbors in a village, however, the definitions do not support such relations.

Evaluation:

The historical data has been split into two groups, a 'training set' and a 'test set'.  For the training set, we provide the outcome ( 'ground truth' ) for each passenger.  You will use this set to build your model to generate predictions for the test set.

For each passenger in the test set, you must predict whether or not they survived the sinking ( 0 for deceased, 1 for survived ).  Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

The Kaggle leaderboard has a public and private component.  50% of your predictions for the test set have been randomly assigned to the public leaderboard ( the same 50% for all users ).  Your score on this public portion is what will appear on the leaderboard.  At the end of the contest, we will reveal your score on the private 50% of the data, which will determine the final winner.  This method prevents users from 'overfitting' to the leaderboard.

Submission Instructions:

You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. This must have exactly 2 columns: PassengerId (which can be sorted in any order), and Survived which contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for did not.

You cannot submit superfluous columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or else the site will show an error with your submission.

For an example, see the file "gendermodel.csv" on the Data page.
